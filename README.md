A mock dating app using React and sql database

Fish in a Barrel is a mock dating app. It uses a node and express backend. jQuery is used for DOM interaction.
It exhibits an attractive user interface. 

There is a lot of room for future development. Currently the app takes the answers given by the user and averages and compares
them with users in the database. In the future users would be able to create a profile, get a range of candidates,
and send messages to each other. The next thing being developed is a photo cropping tool so that profile pictures would fit a format.
